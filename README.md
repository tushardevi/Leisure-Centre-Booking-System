Database system designed specifically for a leisure centre

How to use the system
******************************************
Introduction

In my prototype I have designed and developed the most important objectives to run the system. There are two parts in my system, the staff area and member area. 

Staff Area

To access the staff area, type the password: admin

I have already created a staff member with the Staff ID : marc_smith and Password: 12345678

You can use these details to sign in to add or remove facilities.

You will have to register to start booking facilities.
